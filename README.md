Project-Landing-Page

In this Project, Iâ€™ve created a basic landing page using HTML5 and CSS3. The structure of this page is designed to be elegant and aesthetically pleasing. It follows web design standards using flexbox and nesting flexbox items to create fluid webpage design. CSS styling was used to add style to fonts, colour to page spaces, boarders, buttons, and aligning items.

This project was completed on Oracles Virtual Machine with the Xubuntu operating system. Visual Studio Code was used as my working platform.
